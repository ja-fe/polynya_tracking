AVHRR data comes in many forms and resolutions, this directory is for High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) files, which are the raw, unprocessed image band data observed by the sattelite on a 1km-resolution grid.
Note that Local Area Coverage (LAC) files have been discontinued.

This directory should consist of pairs of binary and xml files following NOAA naming conventions, e.g.
NSS.HRPT.NN.D20122.S2350.E0002.B7704545.GC
PROCESSING-CENTER.DATA-TYPE.SPACECRAFT-UNIQUE-ID.YEAR-DAY.START-TIME.STOP-TIME.PROCESSING-BLOCK-ID.SOURCE
Note that the ending characters are the source identifier and not a filetype extension
