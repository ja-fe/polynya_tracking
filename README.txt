This is an individual project looking at contemporary techniques in remote sensing analysis, specifically:
	Computer vision methods for coastline and polynya detection
	Extrapolation of physical/ecological quantities from raw datasets including AVHRR

Data is not tracked by the repo, and can be instead retrieved from publically available sources such as EarthData, NOAA, NSIDC, etc.

This repo is public for educational purposes; please read the associated text files in all sections for citations on the origins of techniques, methods of analysis, etc.
